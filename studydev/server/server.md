# what is a vps ??
## - Virtual private server

- A VPS is a **virtual machine** that provides virtualized server resources on a **physical server** that is shared with other users.

- With VPS hosting, you get **dedicated server space** with a reserved amount of resources, offering greater control and customization than shared hosting.
 
## How does a VPS work?
Even though you are sharing one physical server with other users, a VPS simulates a dedicated server hosting environment. Your hosting provider installs a **hypervisor**
>    - **hypervisor** is a virtual layer on top of the operating system (OS) of the physical server that you can run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.

This layer enables each of these compartments to run its own OS and software, allowing each environment to function independently from one another. 

Even though you are technically sharing resources with other users, your resources are guaranteed. You pay for a defined amount, which is allocated to your VPS and cannot be used by another account. 

## different types of web hosting services available.

>- **Shared hosting** is when multiple users share a single physical server and all of its resources. However, you are not allocated a set amount of resources, meaning your websiteâ€™s computing power and memory can be affected by **the needs of other users**.

>- **Dedicated hosting**, on the hand, provides an entire **physical server and all of its resources are reserved for your business alone**. You get full control over everything, from hardware to operating system to custom server software.

>- **VPS** hosting sits at the **midpoint between shared hosting and dedicated hosting**. Unlike shared hosting, **you get a defined amount of resources allocated to your VPS**. Plus, you can enjoy many advantages of dedicated hosting for a more affordable price, including your own OS, server applications, and root access control.
